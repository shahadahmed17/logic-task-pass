#Q1:- Write a method that will remove any given character from a String?

# using replace method, the original word is "computer engineering"
word = "Computer Engineering"
print ("Original string: " + word )  

#  removal of the character "r"
print ("The string after removal of character: " + word.replace('r', '')) 
   


#Q2:- Write a program to find all prime numbers up to a given range of numbers?


# range creation to find the prime number within this range,  with adding 1 to max to include it in the range 
min = int(input("Enter the min : "))
max = int(input("Enter the max : "))
for n in range(min,max+1):
    
# a prime number is only divisible by itself and 1, modern maths doesnot include 1 in this rule 
   if n > 1:
       for i in range(2,n):
           if (n % i) == 0:
               break
       else:
           print(n)
           
           
#Q3:- write a function that count how many the given character repeated in a given string?

import collections
string1 = ' There is a greater danger from AI if we allow it to become self designing for it can improve itself rapidly and we may lose control'
d = collections.defaultdict(int)
for c in string1:
    d[c] += 1

for c in sorted(d, key=d.get, reverse=True):
  if d[c] > 1:
      print('%s %d' % (c, d[c]))
